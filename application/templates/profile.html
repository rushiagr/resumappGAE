            <p class="lead">Summary</p>
            <p>I work as an engineer primarily involved in developing software to integrate NetApp
            software products with Cinder - the block storage service for OpenStack - the opensource,
            massively scalable cloud operating system. I personally enjoy the OpenSource work and the
            community responsibility which comes along with it.
            In my spare time, I like thinking and noticing how
            almost all softwares/apps can be made better. I keep
            trying my hands at implementing some funky idea or the other.</p>
